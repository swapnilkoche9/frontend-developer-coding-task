# Moebel.de Frontend developer coding task

## Brief

The goal is to create a weather app that shows the weather forecast for a given city. We recommend to either use https://openweathermap.org/api or create a mock api, for instance via https://github.com/typicode/json-server

Please fork this repository and apply your solution into it. Once you are done you can share it with us. We are expecting you to finish this task in one week but if you think you will not be able to deliver the solution in time, you can contact us and ask for more time. If there is something unclear please feel free to create an issue in this repository.

On the other hand, feel free to add or change the features to improve UX.

**Details**

- The initial city can either be hardcoded or resolved via browser api
- Days should start at the current day and the next four days should be shown (so five days altogether)
- Background gradient should change based on temperature:
  - Teal shades for less than 15°C
  - Orange shades for greater or equal than 15°C
- The content should have a blur effect when the city input field gets focused
- In case there is no result for a given city name, an error message should be shown. There are no design specifications for this error message. It's on you to create and style this in a suitable way
